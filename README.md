# Neural-Network-Simple
This project involves the creation of a basic neural network using C++. Designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts like forward propagation, backpropagation, and training, it also incorporates threading and process forking to enhance performance and provide a learning experience in concurrent programming techniques. This project serves as an educational tool to understand neural networks and their implementation in C++

# To Run
